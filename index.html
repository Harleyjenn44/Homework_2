                <p>Hello! This is all about me! My name is Ashton and I was born and raised in Kansas City. I graduated
                    from Sumner
                    Academy of the Arts and Sciences. I originally wanted to become a pharmacist when I graduated from
                    high school
                    but found out that it wasn't the career for me. So here I am. I'm on my way to becoming a software
                    engineer. I
                    chose this as a career because my passion is volunteering for different non-profits. My favorite
                    non-profit is
                    To Write Love On Her Arms. They offer a lot a support for people struggling with addiction or mental
                    health.
                </p>
                <p>For fun, I enjoy spending time with my friends and animals. I have two amazing best friends and one
                    amazing
                    boyfriend. My mom and they are my biggest supporters for this career.
                </p>

                <p>With this career, I hope to be able to help my community and be able to raise a family comfortably. I
                    love
                    computers and I'm a really quick learner. That is why I think I'll do great in this field and make a
                    great
                    career for me.
                </p>
